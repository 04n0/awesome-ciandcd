###Build And Release System
The system for software build and release, continuous integration and continuous delivery.

- [BuildForge](https://jazz.net/downloads/rational-build-forge)  Automate and accelerate build and release processes  
- [ElectricCommander](http://www.electric-cloud.com/products/electriccommander.php)  
- [Teamcity](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/index.html)  Ready to work, extensible 
and developer-friendly build server — out of the box 
- [bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo)  Bamboo does more than just run builds and tests. It connects issues, commits, test results, and deploys so the whole picture is available to your entire product team  
- [go](http://www.go.cd)  Automate and streamline the build-test-release cycle for worry-free, continuous delivery of your product  
- [hudson](http://hudson-ci.org)  the previous one of Jenkins

Visually define and debug your build scripts, then schedule them with windows scheduler, or integrate them with Continua CI, Jenkins or any other CI Server  
- [VisualBuild](http://www.kinook.com/VisBuildPro)  Visual Build enables developers and build masters to easily create an automated, repeatable build process
